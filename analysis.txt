my assigned variable is PG5_12NWG, or the number of watchers on a github project. 

One of the issues with my provided data set is that almost 68% of the data is comletely empty.
this prevents the analysis script from deducing an accurate representation of the dataset.

with that being said, the data retrieved from the set has a very low overall correlation 
with other data sets. all correllating R^2 values for PG5_12NWG are within the range of
+0.2 and -0.1. I believe the reason for the low corrolation between all variables comes down
to two factors: 

	1) Just because a Github project has a large number of viewers doesn't mean that the
		package is benificial to a project.

	2) A Github repository can use any language to develop code (you could be developing
		in Java, but a Javascript package is useless to you).

as for the analysis of my data, I looked at a few relations within the data. the first relation 
that i looked at was the correlation between the answer given and if the participant finished
the survey. The results of my analysis show that only 5 of the people that answered my variable
didn't finish the survey.

If i were to try and improve how this variable correlates to other data, I would emphisize that 
the github project in question is written in the same language as your project. I believe that 
the reason why most participants categorized it as "not a proprity" is because of that issue,
and if they are looking at releases in the language they are looking for, they will check the 
most popular ones first.
